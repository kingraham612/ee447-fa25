So, we simply calculate the next state $x[k+1]$ as current state $x[k] + dx$. In a program, we would do this iteratively in a loop. For every iteration of the loop, we advance forward in time by $dt$ seconds, and then calculate the next state. We would do this over a certain number of iterations, which is determined by the length of time of the simulation and the simulation rate (i.e., time step, $dt$).  \n",
